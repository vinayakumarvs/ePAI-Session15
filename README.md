# Session 15 - Generators and Iteration tools

# EPAi Session15 Assignment

### Objective of Assignment:

For this project we are using a file that contains some parking ticket violations for NYC.(It's just a tiny extract!)

Full data set is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-parking-tickets/version/2#

For this sample data set, the file is named: *nyc_parking_tickets_extract.csv*

## Objective - 1

Create a lazy iterator that will return a named tuple of the data in each row. The data types should be appropriate - i.e. if the column is a date, you should be storing dates in the named tuple, if the field is an integer, then it should be stored as an integer, etc.


## Objective - 2

Calculate the number of violations by car make.

## Note:
Try to use lazy evaluation as much as possible - it may not always be possible though! That's OK, as long as it's kept to a minimum.
